# Frontend Practice Projects

I built these projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to sharpen my frontend development skills.  
Each one helped me level up in different areas

## Projects
- **Quiz App** â€“ Test your knowledge with a fun quiz game.
- **Expense Tracker** â€“ Track and manage your spending.
- **Recipe Search** â€“ Find recipes using ingredient or keyword search.
- **Color Generator** â€“ Generate random colors and their hex codes.
- **GitHub Finder** â€“ Search for GitHub users and view their profiles.
